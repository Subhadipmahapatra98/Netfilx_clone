MOVIE NAME :- 1. The Lighthouse</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Lighthouse, a work of period-piece insanity that more than fulfills the promise of his 2015 debut The Witch. On a New England rock enshrouded in crashing-wave mist and bombarded with torrential rain, 19th-century lighthouse keepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) tend to their duties, with the former manning the illuminated tower and the latter maintaining their domicile and coal-burning furnace. Their laborious toil is compounded first by interpersonal tensions over Wake’s possessiveness regarding the lighthouse itself, and then by run-ins with squawking gulls (vessels for dead sailors’ spirits, says Wake) and visions of slimy tentacles and inviting mermaids. Shot in luminously grainy 4:3 black-and-white that gives the action the look of a weathered old photograph, scored to unholy bellowing and siren shrieks, and driven by ornate storybook dialogue fit for a nautical nightmare, it’s a film about guilt, shame and greed (and the psychosis it begets) that exudes cramped, soggy malevolence.</p>

MOVIE NAME :- 2. Marriage Story</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Divorce is a cataclysm that destroys the past, present and future—as well as forces one to reconfigure their very sense of self—and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story captures that upheaval with stinging authenticity and insight. The separation of Brooklyn theater director Charlie (Adam Driver) and actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) begins with amicable intentions but soon devolves into a costly and traumatizing legal war that’s carried out by cutthroat, self-interested lawyers (Laura Dern, Ray Liotta), and strands the couple’s young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) in the middle of a figurative (and, at one point, literal) tug of war. Their ensuing custody fight centers on which coast their kid will call home, and Baumbach’s sharp writing and visuals—full of close-ups of pain and fury, and remote compositions that separate and isolate his adrift protagonists—locates the way in which that battle inevitably warps that which was once good, leaving only resentment and ruin in its wake. No film on the subject has ever been this bracingly true to life, and much of the credit for that triumph goes to Driver and Johansson, whose superlative dueling performances—wounded and righteous, forlorn and furious, and marked by respective musical numbers—are as subtle as they are wrenchingly real.</p>

MOVIE NAME :- 3. The Irishman</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
Reuniting him with his favorite stars (as well as Al Pacino), and clocking in at a whopping 209 minutes, The Irishman serves as Martin Scorsese’s grand closing statement on the gangster genre he helped elevate to greatness with 1990’s Goodfellas and 1995’s Casino. Using revolutionary (and largely effective) de-aging CGI to make his cast appear decades younger, the director’s adaptation of Charles Brandt’s non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses recounts the criminal life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), an enforcer for mafioso Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and close compatriot of Teamsters bigwig Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), the latter of whom he reportedly executed in 1975. An era-spanning tale that charts the intersections of the mob and domestic politics (including the election and assassination of JFK), Scorsese’s film is also a flashback-layered drama about the passage of time, and the impact – or chilling lack thereof – that regret, treachery and immorality have on a man’s soul. Led by bravura turns from its leads (Pesci quiet and menacing; De Niro stoic and empty; Pacino fiery and charismatic), it’s an epic about American corruption and underworld dishonor.</p>

MOVIE NAME :- 4. Transit</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In a Europe that simultaneously resembles today and 1940, German expat Georg (Franz Rogowski) endeavors to escape Paris before the arrival of encroaching Nazi-esque fascists. Arriving in Marseilles, he befriends the African son (Lilien Batman) and wife (Maryam Zaree) of a former comrade. Through circumstance, he also assumes the guise of famous writer Weidel, whose possessions he acquires and whose documentation permitting travel to Mexico await him at the port city’s embassy. So too does Weidel’s wife Marie (Paula Beer), who repeatedly mistakes Georg for her husband, and who longs for reunion even as she continues an affair with a man (Godehard Giese) whose obsessive amour prevents him from departing. Borders to cross and barriers impeding passage are omnipresent in Transit, which like so much of writer/director Christian Petzold’s transition-fixated oeuvre, is a forlorn romantic reverie about identity, regret, trauma and rebirth. Moreover, it’s another of his masterworks to confront issues of personal and national consciousness through a distinct cine-filter, with Casablanca and The Passenger proving two of its many spiritual touchstones.</p>

MOVIE NAME :- 5.  A Hidden Life</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In the masterful hands of Terrence Malick, fascism isn’t simply a socio-political threat, but a moral and spiritual one as well. The director’s A Hidden Life recounts the based-on-true-events tale of Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), a farmer in the rural Austrian enclave of Radegund whose world is forever altered by the 1939 appearance of the Nazis—and the requirement, once he’s forced to join the Third Reich’s army, that he swear allegiance to Hitler’s party. Franz’s refusal to do so is fraught with perilous consequences not only for himself, but also for his wife Franziska (Valerie Pachner), whose staunch loyalty to her husband in the face of communal ostracism is as courageous as is his ethical stand against tyranny. Malick’s tale couldn’t be timelier, nor lovelier, as his poetic aesthetics —defined by swirling, sweeping, intimate-and-epic handheld cinematography, James Newton Howard’s soaring orchestral score, and hushed internal-monologue narration—impart a sense of the alternately harmonious and dissonant relationship between the material and the celestial.</p>

MOVIE NAME :- 6. Little Women</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Greta Gerwig establishes herself as one of world cinema’s finest directors with Little Women, an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel that’s bursting with effervescent life. Led by a collection of outstanding performances thrumming with adolescent liveliness, longing, regret, resentment and resolve, the film revisits the diverse ups-and-downs of the March sisters. Independent writer Jo (Saoirse Ronan); conservative actress Meg (Emma Watson); prim painter Amy (Florence Pugh); and unwell pianist Beth (Eliza Scanlen). Alongside their doting mother (Laura Dern), unpleasant rich aunt (Meryl Streep) and dreamboat neighbor Laurie (Timothée Chalamet), the siblings attempt to make their way in a world where, per Amy and Jo, female sovereignty is only achieved with money, and marriage is both an economic transaction and a bond forged by love.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME :- 7. Uncut Gems</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Adam Sandler is a loser who can’t stop chasing that elusive victory in Uncut Gems, an anxiety-inducing crime film fueled by its protagonist’s addiction to the rush of risking it all. Harold Ratner (Sandler) is a Manhattan diamond district wheeler-dealer who thinks he’s hit it big with a rare opal smuggled out of Ethiopia thanks to some African Jews. His plan is to sell it at auction for a cool million, and thus settle his debts to brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) and his violent associates. That scheme, however, is mucked up by an encounter with Boston Celtics superstar Kevin Garnett (playing himself), a legitimate winner who takes a fancy to the valuable rock, as well as by conflicts with his business partner (Lakeith Stanfield), wife (Idina Menzel) and mistress (Julia Fox). Directors Josh and Benny Safdie’s material operates at a relentless fever pitch, their camera gliding and rotating with the jittery excitement and terror of Ratner, and zooming into characters’ eyes—and observing them at a crane-assisted remove on city streets—with gritty ‘70s-era stylishness.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME :- 8. Hagazussa</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Dark, demonic power courses through Hagazussa, a legitimately evil folk story of inheritance, corruption and damnation. In the Austrian Alps circa the 15th century, young Albrun (Celina Peter) tends to her mother (Claudia Martini), a supposed witch, in their remote log cabin. Years later, adult Albrun (Aleksandra Cwen) cares for her infant daughter in that same abode, whose only visitor is Swinda (Tanja Petrovsky), a neighbor who, like the local priest, seems concerned with saving ostracized Abrun’s soul. Light on dialogue but heavy on black-magic mystery, writer/director Lukas Feigelfeld’s fable casts its spell via slow-burn plotting and malevolent imagery, culminating with a kaleidoscopic underwater visual orgy of blood, roots, bone, tendrils, and mutating shapes. Like the mist that covers the mountainous region’s treetops, suggestions of profane forces are everywhere – in the sight of Albrun milking her goat, or a shrine for a skull – and they burrow under one’s skin, much like the unholy whispering and thunderous bass heard on a soundtrack that heralds madness, doom, the end.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME :- 9. Under the Silver Lake</h5>
        <p class="card-text">TThere are codes within codes within codes in Under the Silver Lake, David Robert Mitchell’s deliriously shambolic neo-noir about stoner sleuth Sam (Andrew Garfield, never better) traversing a Lynch-ian L.A. landscape in search of a mysterious missing beauty (Riley Keough). Also channeling the spirit of Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Alfred Hitchcock and Hollywood golden-age classics (set to a Henry Mancini-esque score), Sam’s cine-odyssey is a quest for meaning in an overstuffed pop-culture world. Movies and myths collide, both mirthfully and mournful, as Sam strives to uncover the knotty conspiracy-theory connections linking everything and everyone. From Super Mario Bros., new-age cultists, pirates and bomb-shelter tombs, to masturbatory porn patterns, dog killers, comic books (Spider-Man, wink wink) and song lyrics scribbled on pizza boxes, secret world-governing ciphers are ubiquitous. Mitchell reveals them through an adventure that’s witty, aesthetically dexterous, and laced with dark disillusionment about the puppetmaster powers-that-be and their covert machinations.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME :- 10. Climax</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Gaspar Noé’s cinema routinely traces the line from harmony to chaos, and that’s once again true in Climax, the inspired-by-real-events tale of a dance party descending into hellish madness. Beginning, portentously, with interviews seen on a television set surrounded by the director’s favorite VHS horror films, the French auteur’s latest is arguably his least provocative to date. Regardless, it’s still an escalating freak-out scored to thumping electronica and populated by a raft of potential monsters. Even during its more serene earlygoing, his characters’ choreographed numbers exhibit a frightening intensity, and once these artists unwittingly drink some LSD-spiked punch, their emotional equilibrium and interpersonal relationships spiral terrifyingly out of control. Often executed in long single takes, Noé’s swirling, floating, slithering camerawork is as dexterous as his physically agile subjects. The result is an aesthetic performance piece that feels like the psychosexual underworld dance extravaganza that Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria wanted to be, replete with a finale that takes up residence in some hallucinatory ninth circle of Hell.</p>
