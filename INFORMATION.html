With her face irreparably burnt, Malti undergoes medico-social rehabilitation, a prolonged string of facial surgeries, a legal battle against her attacker and a constant struggle to become economically independent.

During this time, Malti also joins a campaign against Acid violence and comes across other victims. She forms an inexplicable bond with Amol, the founder of the campaign but it is Malti`s game-changing PIL in the Supreme Court of India, with her lawyer Archana Bajaj, that inspires the Judiciary to amend the laws on acid violence.

        <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME : - Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior(HINDI,MARATHI)</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Tanhaji Malusare was an unsung warrior from the 17th century. His acts of valour and bravery continued to inspire soldiers long after he lost his life in battle.
Endowed with a body of steel, the courage of a lion and an agile mind, Tanhaji was also one of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj`s closest aides and trusted lieutenants. Ready to lay down his life for his King and country, this braveheart planned a surgical strike to get back the Kondana Fort against the Mughal army headed by Udaybhan.
When the fort of Kondana, that was the pride of the Marathas was under the control of Udaybhan and a Mughal army, Tanhaji went to war armed only with a handful of Marathas. If the Mughals had muscle power, Tanhaji had sharp acumen. The only unfortunate thing is--the Marathas won Kondana but they lost their Lion. Tanhaji left behind a void that none in history could ever fill.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">MOVIE NAME : - Darbar(TAMIL, HINDI, TELUGU, MALAYALAM)</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The superstar Rajinikanth plays the role of Aditya Arunachalam, an unconventional cop who likes to do things his way. Darbar is an action thriller that follows this `bad cop` as he solves a group of murders.Today is a big day for Rajinikanth. Darbar is his 167th movie in a career spanning nearly five decades. The movie comes at an important juncture in his life, especially when Rajinikanth is facing the heat from younger actors such as Vijay and Ajith Kumar, in his fiefdom — Tamil Nadu.

Exactly a year ago, Rajinikanth’s Petta clashed with Ajith’s Viswasam on Pongal. The trade was taken by surprise when Thala outdid Thalaivar, as far as the Tamil Nadu box-office was concerned. Though Petta was a hit, it would not have grossed as much as Bigil and Viswasam did in Tamil Nadu. Reports seem to suggest that today’s millennials are rooting for Vijay and Ajith — the reason why they are eating into Rajinkanth’s business.</p>

Directed by Sachin Ravi, Avane Srimannarayana stars Rakshit Shetty in the lead role.The producer, who is getting trained to be an actor, has now pushed the start of his film to next year, as he wants to completely concentrate on the release of ASN. “Since we are having a simultaneous release in five languages, even 18 hours per day feels less for completing the job,” says Pushkar, revealing that the dubbing for the Telugu and Tamil versions has been done, and they have now started with Malayalam. Hindi dubbing will be taken up next, and will be completed in the next 15 days</p>

      <p class="card-text">After Palpatine mysteriously returns, the Resistance faces the First Order once more in the final chapter of the Skywalker saga.

This is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and will serve as the culmination of the Skywalker saga. Jurassic World helmsman Colin Trevorrow was originally named director back in 2015 when the film first entered development, but he parted ways with Lucasfilm due to creative differences over the script. In September 2017, Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams signed on to finish what he started.

In July 2018, Lucasfilm officially announced the film's cast, which primarily consists of returning stars from Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Newcomers include Keri Russell, Richard E. Grant, Dominic Monaghan, and Naomi Ackie. Filming started in August 2018.
